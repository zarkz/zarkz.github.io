                         <p>Our research addresses multiple aspects of language use and comprehension, focusing on real-time language processing, with the aim of better understanding what kinds of linguistic and non-linguistic information is recruited during the interpretation process.</p>
                         <p>Much of our work deals with the kinds of default processing mechanisms that are used to assign some initial structure to linguistic input, and the extent to which those mechanisms are under automatic or strategic control.</p><p>We are particularly concerned with how such processing mechanisms might be integrated with representations and processes posited by current theory in linguistics and cognitive science. Examples of recent output can be found below.</p>
