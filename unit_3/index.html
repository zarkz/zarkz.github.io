	<p>Welcome to the Language Processing Lab at UCLA! We are an interdisciplinary research space dedicated to exploring language and cognition through a multitude of methods. Current projects include behavioral judgments to written and auditory stimuli, eye movements, EEG recording, mouse tracking, and corpus work.</p>
	<p>Our current research topics include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Structural defaults in processing metonymy</li>
		<li>Processing sluices with d-linked remnants</li>
		<li>Effect of lexical neighborhood on real-time lexical decision processing</li>
		<li>Implicit prosody and garden path sentences (with Sun-Ah Jun)</li>
		<li>Biases for resolving exceptive ellipis structures (with Katy Carlson)</li>
		<li>Preferences for focus realization with focus sensitive particles (with Katy Carlson)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>We have many opportunities for participation in research.
